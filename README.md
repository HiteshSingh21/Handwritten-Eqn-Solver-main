# ✍️ Handwritten Equation Solver

## 📖 Overview
The **Handwritten Equation Solver** is a deep learning project that detects and solves handwritten mathematical equations.  
It uses a trained neural network model to recognize handwritten digits and operators from an input image, reconstructs the equation, and evaluates the result.  
A simple web interface built with **Flask** allows users to upload or draw equations and instantly get the solved output.

## 🧩 Features
- 🖋️ Recognizes handwritten mathematical symbols and numbers  
- 🧮 Automatically evaluates the detected equation  
- 🌐 Flask web app interface for easy interaction  
- 🤖 Deep learning model (Keras/TensorFlow) for character recognition  
- 📷 Image preprocessing for better accuracy

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### 🔧 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later  
- pip (Python package manager)  

### 🪄 Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Handwritten-Eqn-Solver.git
   cd Handwritten-Eqn-Solver/HandCalc
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads or draws a handwritten equation.
2. The image is preprocessed and segmented into individual symbols.
3. Each symbol is recognized using the trained neural network.
4. The recognized symbols are combined into a mathematical expression.
5. The expression is evaluated and displayed as the final result.
